# Project Report - Mustafa Siddiqui
## VLEAD month 1: - 
+ Initially started working on topological sort Demo, completed design spec, content.
+ Deliverables extended to js library for graphs and trees
+ Implemented fully responsive heap generator using vanilla js with labelable nodes and highlightable edges.
+ Implemented an undirected graph generator where user can choose the positioning of his/her graph nodes and can draw custom edges.
+ Implemented a randomised undirected graph generator such that no 3 nodes are colleniar.
+ Implemented a directed graph generator where user can choose the positioning of his/her graph nodes and draw his own custom directed edges.
+ Implemented a randomised directed grah generator such that no 3 nodes are colleniar.
+ Implemented a randomised DAG generator where all the directed graphs generated are DAGs.
+ Later specs for library changed to template based random graphs and no pure random graphs (pseudo-random).
+ All visual components were linked to background data structures which updated in real time.
+ Development for the library was called off and the library was accepted as a deliverable.
## VLEAD month 2: -
+ In pursuit of completing the library I start working with Prof. Venkatesh Chopella.
+ Designed and decided on initial model for development.
+ Implemented split screen SVG insertion for pane projects.
+ Implemented implemented complete basic bubblesort demo in React.
+ Integration of Scala background functions with React.
+ Dynamic sizing of arrays for the bubblesort demo
+ Seeing impracticality of Scala in this use-case, re-wrote scala code to vanilla JavaScript.
+ Implemented dynamic sized rendering of arrays and linked React application to afore-mentioned JavaScript file.
+ Finished writing v 0.0.1 of the App and exported it as an npm package.
+ Re-wrote entire react application to change component heirarchy, to maintain state.
+ Implemented components for text, image, and video artefacts.
+ Managed state such that there is synchronity among multiple DOMs.
+ Created a python script to extract data from incoming raw HTML and store it in a JSON format.
+ Redesigned the model to manipulate the raw HTML directly.
+ Rendered barebones bubblesort using new design model.
+ Worked on maintaining synchronity for new model using deepCloning of our model instance.
+ Rebuilding initially created visual components to accomodate new changes.
+ Finished implementing artefact rendering on raw html input.
+ Created standard templates and a table structure to invoke said templates in author prompt
+ Redesigned model again to accomodate for changes in design.
+ release 0.0.1-alpha
+ Integrated aforementioned application with Atirek's pane application.
+ Library was accepted as a deliverable
